# Hotwheel - Additional Context Menu with Modular Plugin Support

Hotwheel is an innovative application designed to create a circular context menu, offering modular plugin support to enhance user interactions. The window displays plugins arranged in a circular layout, allowing users to execute them by moving the mouse in the direction of the corresponding segment. This project aims to fill a crucial missing interaction in the workflow, ultimately boosting productivity.

## Installation
To get started with Hotwheel, follow these simple steps:
1. Download the latest release.
2. Run the `run.vbs` script.

## Writing a Plugin
Creating a new plugin for Hotwheel is straightforward. Use the provided example plugin as a template, with the following key functions:

- **\_\_init\_\_:** This function is called upon starting the program.
- **\_\_Execute\_\_:** This function is triggered when the plugin is selected in the context menu.

After a plugin is executed, the user interface reloads, and any changes made to the ContextElement are applied.

To install a package for use in your plugin, execute the following command:

```bash
.\bin\python.exe -m pip install --target=.\plugins\libs\ PackageName
```
Remember to upload the __libs__ folder along with your plugin when sharing. 
## Customization
Adjusting the placement of a plugin in the context menu is possible by changing the number in the index file in the plugin's folder. The wheel's origin point is set at 90¬∞. For additional customization options, refer to the settings.py file.
